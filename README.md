stmspectra

Plotting tool for STMAFM 3.1 data. Inputs .VERT files to conveniently compare spectra.

Can show details for spectra such as modulation voltage, voltage and z ramps, and set point current.

Can perform some simple analysis: normalize based on z ramp and average forward/backward sweeps implementing a hysteresis correction.
